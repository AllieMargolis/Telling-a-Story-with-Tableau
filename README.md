# Telling-a-Story-with-Tableau
Udacity project to utilize Tableau to analyze and report insights on a data set.

The requirement was to find a data set, clean it, analyze it, and prepare a Tableau visual presentation alongside a written report on the process. The Tableau presentation can be found in the hyperlinks found in the report.
